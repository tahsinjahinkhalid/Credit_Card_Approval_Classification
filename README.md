# Credit Card Approval Classification
## By: Tahsin Jahin Khalid
This is a machine learning project that analyzes the Kaggle Dataset and does a classification task of determining whether a credit card is approved or not.

### Technology Used:
- Python (for Data Preprocessing)
- Orange Data Mining

### Dataset
- [Kaggle - Credit Card Approval](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/youssefaboelwafa/credit-card-approval/)
- GPT4 (test data generation)

#### About Dataset
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming.
